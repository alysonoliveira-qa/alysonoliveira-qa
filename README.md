## 👋 Hi, I'm Alyson Oliveira

I'm a **Quality Assurance professional in clear transition to Quality Engineering**, focused on automation, testing strategy, and engineering mindset.

My journey started with manual and functional testing, but over time I naturally evolved toward **test automation, system behavior validation, and maintainable test design** — treating tests as engineering assets rather than simple scripts.

---

## 🚀 What I'm currently working on

- Test automation using **Cypress & TypeScript**
- Designing **realistic test scenarios** based on real user behavior
- Validating applications through **business rules and UX behavior**
- Turning technical exercises into **portfolio-ready case studies**
- Documenting decisions, trade-offs, and known issues clearly

---

## 🧠 QA → QE Mindset

- Quality as a **shared engineering responsibility**
- Tests focused on **behavior, not implementation**
- Assertions based on **what really protects the product**
- Documentation as part of the quality process
- Continuous learning through hands-on practice

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Cypress  
- TypeScript / JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub (commits, PRs, documentation)  
- CI-friendly test design  
- Agile & real-world QA workflows  

---

## 📂 Featured Work

### 🔹 QA Automation Case — Cypress Real World App
A practical automation case covering **Login and Sign Up flows**, where I document:
- Test strategy
- Test cases and coverage
- Known issues found during testing
